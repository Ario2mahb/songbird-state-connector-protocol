# State Connector Improvement proposal (WIP)

A State Connector Improvement Proposal (SCIP) is a document proposing improvements to the State Connector protocol to the Flare community and attestation providers. A SCIP describes new feature, its motivation and precise specifications. The base of the repository serves as the initial specification of the State Connector protocol. The current specification is the initial specification together with all active SCIPs. If the initial specification is in conflict with an active SCIP, the specification of SCIP have priority. To avoid confusion the initial specifications are to be updated when needed.

The purpose of a SICP is to reach consensus among attestation providers to implement the improvements.

SCIP can pertain any aspect of State Connector.
However, if a SCIP implementation requires a change in the validator node, the improvements are to be confirmed in a FIP (Flare improvement proposal).
